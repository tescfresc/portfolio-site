            Set in a moles burrow, players must fight off waves of oncoming zombie badgers, 
            completing mini-games to unlock doors and revive players. The badgers are hungry for 
            moles, and they are relentless in their hunt for blood. 
            MoleZ is a twin stick wave survival game inspired by games such as Call of Duty: 
            Zombies and Minigore. The game uses the players smartphone as a controller, allowing 
            for interesting mini-games and making co-op games with your friends even easier. The 
            objective of the game is to survive to as high a wave as possible, unlocking rooms and 
            even an upgrade shop as you make your way through the level.

            The main MoleZ game is developed to run on PC or Mac, and the controller app has
            been developed to run on any Android smartphone. This game was made as my final year project of a Ba(Hons) Game Design degree.
            The game and app were both built using Unity development software, as I have the
            most experience with using this software. The game uses Unityâ€™s (now deprecated)
            networking system, specifically the high-level API, to connect the mobile devices to the
            main game. The main game runs as a multiplayer server, and the smartphones connect
            directly as clients. Due to this, the controllers must be on the same network as the main
            game to allow a successful connection. A direct connection allows messages to be sent
            between the clients and server at high speed, with almost no latency on a high-quality
            connection.

            <div class="modal-section-title">USING A PHONE AS A CONTROLLER</div>
            The game is based around the idea of using a smartphone as a controller for a larger game, which has many benefits but also 
            a few drawbacks. Taking these into full consideration, MoleZ manages to create an intuitive and responsive experience that 
            allows the player to forget they're using a phone as a controller. A few of the benefits and drawbacks are outlined below.

                        Most people own a smartphone, so

                        even easier.

                        Content on the controller can be changed

                        player can have their own unique

                        No tactile feedback when pressing
                        buttons, so can be hard to find specific
                        buttons without looking at the screen.

            <div class="modal-section-title">PHONE MINIGAMES</div>
            One of the main ideas behind the concept of MoleZ was the ability to use the smartphone to have minigames that are ran on the smartphone 
            controller that affect the main game in some way. I initially planned to have more varied minigames, but as a POC, the two I created make use of 
            the possibilities of the phone in creative ways. The first minigame the players encounter is when they would like to clear the way to open up new areas of the map. 
            This minigame involves looking at the screen and timing when to press the button to break all the rocks. Due to the way this is designed, it means that the player 
            has to divert attention away from the main game and risk taking damage, to instead focus on the screen of their smartphone. This game scales in difficulty as more doorways 
            are opened.

            The second minigame is used to revive players. If it is a multiplayer game, then the player who is downed and needs reviving has a prompt appear on their 
            screen. Their phone vibrates, similar to a heartbeat, with a random interval. It is then up to them to communicate with the other player 
            what the specific rhythm is, as the player who is reviving them has to move their phone in a CPR fashion in time with their heartbeat. This 
            forces communcation between the players, and brings the game out of the screens and into the real world, taking advantage of the possibilities of the smartphone controller. For players who might have vibration disabled, a visual prompt is also 
            displayed.
